Today's questions help us work towards an application of [discrete time exponential growth](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619). Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be $N_{t+1}$ and $N_t$ in the exponential growth formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate $\lambda$ in the exponential growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported.

Noteably,

a.	Pheasant chicks are born during the summer.
b.	In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35.
c.	November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants.
d.	October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants.
e.	Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died.
f.	During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched.
g.	During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched.
h.	During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.$^1$ 
i.	You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species.

$^1$ Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory.


## Questions

When considering an application to determine the correct values of $\lambda$ and $N_t$ in the exponential growth formula, it helps to understand that for all mathematical formulas there must be the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted.

1. The units of the population size, $N_t$, at time, $t$, are number. The geometric growth rate, $\lambda$ is unitless. Choose an equation from [Vandermeer and Gordon 2013](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619) p1-3 and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation from the last assignment:

\begin{eqnarray*}
N_t & = & N_0 \lambda^t \\
\left(\mbox{number}\right)& =&(\mbox{number}) (\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\
\left(\mbox{number}\right)& =& \left(\mbox{number}\right)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Note that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \bullet & (\mbox{unitless}) \times (\mbox{quantity with units})  =  (\mbox{quantity with units}) \\
& \bullet & (\mbox{unitless})^{(\mbox{quantity})} = (\mbox{unitless})
\end{eqnarray*}

2. Although not stated in the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, $\lambda = 1 + b - d$ where $b$ is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for the lilipad example, or 1 year for the pheasant example), and $d$ is the fraction of the population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless. What must the units of $b$ and $d$ be? [1 mark]

3. In the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, $\lambda = 2$. Given that $\lambda = 1 + b - d$, what are some possible values of $b$ and $d$. Note that $d$ is a fraction and must be $1 \geq d \geq 0$ and $b>0$. [1 mark]

4.	Let $d$ be the fraction of the population that dies each year. By considering a. to i. above, estimate $d$ for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island. Remember $d$ must be a fraction: you need to divide by the number of pheasants that could have died during the time period under consideration. Write down any assumptions you have made. For example, did you assume that the mortality rate for one year is then the same for other years? [3 marks]

<!-- 9. [True or False] For discrete time exponential growth (as per the reading), the change in population size from one week to the next depends not so much on the per capita birth rate, but on the difference between the per capita birth rate and the per capita death rate. [1 mark] -->

<!-- 2. To make a graph of the data listed in b.-d., we need to learn how to work with dates. We will consider two possible approaches: -->

<!-- i. Use a built-in `R` function to convert dates to a format that can be plotted (todays class); and -->

<!-- ii. Convert the dates to number of days since a reference date. Now the dates are numbers and these values can be plotted on the x-axis of a graph (next class). -->

<!-- In this question, we will proceed with option i. The function we will use is `as.Date()`. You can learn how to use this function using an internet search or by typing the following into your `Console`: -->

<!-- ```{r,eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- ?as.Date -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- These files can be difficult to understand (see [R Help files](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/help.html#how-to-interpret-r-help-files). A good way to proceed is to experiment with the function in the `Console`. Try these: -->

<!-- ```{r,eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- as.Date(2012-01-31, format = %Y-%m-%d) -->
<!-- as.Date("2012-01-31", format = "%Y-%m-%d") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that only the second command is error-free. The first command fails because the date argument for the `as.Date()` function must be a character string, i.e., must be enclosed in `""` (see `?character`). -->

<!-- It is also possible to omit the format argument and just code: `as.Date("2012-01-31")`. The help file notes that when the format argument is not specified, that formats will be tried one by one and an error will be returned if none work. It is advisable to specify the format, as allowing the function to infer the format could introduce errors. -->

<!-- Chapter 6.9 [Data structures](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/rintro.html#data-structures) describes how to make a vector (note a vector is a list of numbers rather than just a single number).

<!-- ```{r,eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- x <- as.Date(c("2012-01-31", "2012-03-05", "2013-01-11"), format = "%Y-%m-%d") -->
