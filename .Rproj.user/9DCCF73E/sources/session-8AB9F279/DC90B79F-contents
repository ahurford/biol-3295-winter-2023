Noteably,

a.	Pheasant chicks are born during the summer.
b.	In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35.
c.	November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants.
d.	October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants.
e.	Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died.
f.	During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched.
g.	During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched.
h.	During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.$^1$ 
i.	You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species.

$^1$ Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory.

## Questions

1. Recall that,

\[N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t\]

where $N_{t}$ is the number of individuals in the population at time $t$, $N_{t+1}$ is the number of individuals in the population after one time unit (time is $t+1$), and $\lambda > 0$ is the geometric growth rate. The population is growing if after one time unit, there are more individuals than there are at time $t$, i.e., $N_{t+1}>N_t$. **For what values of $\lambda$ will the population grow?** [Hint: If you find this question difficult, substitute some numbers to help you find the answer. Let $N_t=1$ and then try some values of $\lambda > 0$. Since you let, $N_t = 1$, the population is growing if $N_{t+1}>1$. Give your answer as the value of $\lambda$ such that $N_{t+1}>N_t$] [1 mark]

2.	$b > 0$ is the per capita number of births each year. The estimation of $b$ for an exponential growth model is more subtle. First, $b$ it is estimated as the number of births (occurring between $t$ and $t+1$), divided by the number of individuals that could have given birth, $N_t$. You might average this value across multiple years if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, to correctly project the future population size, we should understand that $b$ is more than the number of individuals born, additionally these individuals must survive to the next time step. **Given a.-i. estimate $b$. Write down any assumptions you have made.** [3 marks]

3.	Recall that $\lambda = 1 + b-d$. What is the value of $\lambda$ given your estimate of $b$ and $d$ from previous questions? Is this population is expected to grow over time? [2 marks]

4.	Lets assume that the pheasant population on Protection Island grows geoemetrically (i.e. exponentially but for a discrete time model) where the geometric growth rate, $\lambda$, is the value that you estimated in question 3. Let $N_0 = 10$ and let $t$ be the number of years since May 1937. Recall that when a population grows geometrically,

\[ N_t = N_0 \lambda^t \]

Use the formula and your answer to 3. to predict the number of pheasants in May 1938, May 1939, May 1940, and May 1950.
