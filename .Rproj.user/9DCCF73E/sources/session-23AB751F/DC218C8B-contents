# Jan 5: Introduction

- Survey of student computer preferences

## Some questions

- What is a population?
- What are some definitions of a population that are given in textbooks?
- In research studies, how are populations discussed in the _Discussion_?
- How are individuals that comprise the sample selected in the _Methods_ of a research study?
- List some potential differences between how populations are defined and discussed and the research methods?
- Why does the definition of a population matter?

- Von Foerster human population become effectively infinite on Nov 13 2026

- Lilly pads replicate once per week. If it take a year for 1/2 a pond to be covered, when will it be completely covered? See also the [wheat and chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem)

- $N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t$ equation 3 in [Vandermeer and Goldberg](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619). For what values of $\lambda$ will the population size, $N_t$, grow?

- $N_t = N_0 \lambda^t$ is equation 4 in [Vandermeer and Goldberg](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619) (but written more generally). With $N_0 > 0$ sketch a graph of $N_t$ for different values of $\lambda$. If $N_0 = 0$, sketch a graph of $N_t$.

- If $N_0 = 1.1$ individuals per km$^2$, $\lambda = 2$, what is is the population size at time $t = 10$?

- Consider population growth of pheasants on [Protection Island](#pheasant). If we were to apply the geometric growth model to the pheasant population, what are some assumptions? How might this affect our parameterization (i.e., our estimate of $\lambda$) for the pheasant population?

- How can we understand what $\lambda$ is in a population that has births and deaths?
