## R Markdown

$N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/biol-4605-data/main/data/corn.csv', fill=TRUE)
summary(data)
mean(data$Psoil)
data$Psoil
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
str(data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
age = seq(1,25)
difference = c(-20, -26, -24, -20, -22, -20, -10, 0,
               20, 23, 9, 5, 12, 14, 16, 10, 8, 6, 7, 11, 5, 6, 4, 5, 10)
data = data.frame(age=age, difference = difference)
```
