# Jan 5: Introduction

- Survey of student computer preferences

## Some questions

- What is a population?
- What are some definitions of a population that are given in textbooks?
- In research studies, how are populations discussed in the _Discussion_?
- How are individuals that comprise the sample selected in the _Methods_ of a research study?
- List some potential differences between how populations are defined and discussed and the research methods?
- Why does the definition of a population matter?

# Jan 17: Geometric growth

## Reading

Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be $N_{t+1}$ and $N_t$ in the geometric growth model formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate $\lambda$ in the geoemtric growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported.

Newcomb, HR. 1940. [Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/js956j801?locale=en), Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. [two pages prior to the title page]

Noteably,

a.	Pheasant chicks are born during the summer.
b.	In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35.
c.	November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants.
d.	October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants.
e.	Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died.
f.	During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched.
g.	During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched.
h.	During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.$^1$ 
i.	You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species.

$^1$ Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory.

# PART II - Instructions {#partI .unlisted .unnumbered}

- [Install](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/install.html) the `dplyr` package, all dependencies, and load the package.

- For instructions to clean data using tidyverse see [here](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#dplyr)

```{r, include=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
require(dplyr)
data = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/biol-4605-data/main/untidy-portal-data.csv")
```

Use `head(data)` in the Console, or `data` to view your data. A helpful command is to know the column names:

```{r}
colnames(data)
# Extract a row
dataX =select(data, "X")
# This is base R syntax to extract specific rows
# as.Date() is needed for R to treat this variable as a date
date.collected = dataX$X[6:14]
date.collected = as.Date(date.collected, format = "%m/%d/%y")
```

I will aim to make a data frame with date collected and weight for Plot 1. Inspecting the data, weigh is `"X.4"` for Plot 1.

```{r}
weight = select(data, "X.4")
# as.numeric() is needed because otherwise R doesn't recognize these data as numbers - which I need for the multiplication later
weight = as.numeric(weight$X.4[6:14])
# Make this into a dataframe
cleaned.data = data.frame(date.collected, weight)
# add a column that is a mutated column
cleaned.data = mutate(cleaned.data,weight.kg = weight/1000)
```

Now the data is in a format that I can make a plot

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
g1=ggplot(data = cleaned.data, aes(x = date.collected, y = weight.kg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Date collected")+
  ylab("Weight in kg")
g1
```
