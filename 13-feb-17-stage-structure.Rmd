# Feb 17: **ASSIGNMENT** Stage-structured population dynamics

Class will be in CSF 2218

ASSIGNMENT 3 is due on March 3.

[currently unfinished]

We will do this exact example in lecture. Here we are
verifying that we can get the same conclusions using R.

Install and load the `popbio` package.

```{r}
require("popbio")
```

Define our projection matrix:
```{r}
A = matrix(c(0,2,0.5,.1), 2,2, byrow=TRUE)
```

Type `A` into the console to check that A has the correct number of rows and columns and the numerical entries in the correct place.

The function `eigen()` is a built-in function that will calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the projection matrix `A`:

```{r}
ev = eigen(A)
```

Type `ev` into the console. There are two eigenvalues. Why are there two? Which is the dominant eigenvalue? Will this population grow (for a positive initial number of individuals)?

There is an eigenvector (2 rows x 1 column) associated with each eigenvalue (= 2 eignvectors). The eigenvector associated with the $n^{th}$ eigenvalue is in column $n$.

The dominant eigenvalue is the first one. Therefore, the associated right eigenvector, that will tell us about the long-term relative stage abundance, is in the first column.

```{r}
vec1 = ev$vectors[,1]
```

Eigenvectors are not unique - they can be multiplied by a constant and are still the same eigenvector:

```{r}
norm.vec1 = -100*vec1
```

What happens if our initial population size is a right eigenvector?

```{r}
vec2 = A%*%norm.vec1
vec3 = A%*%vec2
```

How does this compare to if the right eigenvector is multiplied by the dominant eigenvalue?

```{r}
1.05*norm.vec1
```

Let's simulate the long term population dyanmics:


<!-- tvec = seq(1,30,1) -->
<!-- n = matrix(0,length(tvec),3) -->
<!-- n[,1]=tvec -->
<!-- n[1,2:3] = c(89,47) -->
<!-- for(t in seq(1,length(tvec)-1,1)){ -->
<!--   n[t+1,2:3] = A%*%n[t,2:3] -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- # Plot the long-term population dynamics -->
<!-- plot(n[,1], n[,2], typ = "l", col = "red", ylim = c(0,200), ylab = "stage abundance", xlab = "time", main = "Initial stage abundance is an eigenvector") -->
<!-- lines(n[,1], n[,3]) -->

<!-- # How does the proportion of the population in the first (juvenile stage) -->
<!-- # change over time -->
<!-- plot(tvec,n[,2]/(n[,2]+n[,3]), typ="l", ylab = "proportion juveniles", xlab = "time", ylim =c(0,1), main = "Initial stage abundance is an eigenvector") -->

<!-- # Next, determine the longterm population dynamics where the initial -->
<!-- # abundance does not begin on an eigenvector. -->
<!-- tvec = seq(1,50,1) -->
<!-- n = matrix(0,length(tvec),3) -->
<!-- n[,1]=tvec -->
<!-- n[1,2:3] = c(0,100) -->
<!-- for(t in seq(1,length(tvec)-1,1)){ -->
<!--   n[t+1,2:3] = A%*%n[t,2:3] -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- plot(n[,1], n[,2], typ = "l", col = "red", ylim = c(0,1000), ylab = "stage abundance", xlab = "time", main = "Initial stage abundance not an eigenvector") -->
<!-- lines(n[,1], n[,3]) -->

<!-- plot(tvec,n[,2]/(n[,2]+n[,3]), typ="l", ylab = "proportion juveniles", xlab = "time", ylim =c(0,1), main = "Initial stage abundance not an eigenvector") -->
