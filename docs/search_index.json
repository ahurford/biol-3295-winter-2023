Should lectures be remote a WebEx link will be provided on BrightSpace. Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course consists of lectures, 4 data analysis assignments, 2 exams and a final exam.  Course expectations: Please attend lectures and respect the learning environment of other students. If you have COVID-19 please follow university and provincial public health guidelines. Learning goals: The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have seen much of the course material in pre-requisite courses. In this course, I will revisit the models, clarify the assumptions and when they are appropriate, and we will fit the models to data to estimate parameters. By the end of the course, I hope that if you were given population data, that you would know the key quantities that you might estimate, and could complete the analysis. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/biol-3295-winter-2023/index.html.

PART I is to reproduce a figure and the figure caption of a plot in Vandermeer and Goldberg 2013 or another textbook or a published paper in Rmarkdown and as an output file: .hmtl, .pdf, or .docx. Please choose a figure to reproduce in the area of Population Biology or Evolutionary Ecology. You can simplify a complex figure if necessary. Your figure should be made in ggplot() and have: the title (if there is one), axes labels, points or lines or both, approximately the same data as the original figure, the correct axes limits. The objective is for you to learn how to use Rmarkdown to make a synthetic write-up that includes code, a figure and text. Your completed output should have: A brief text description of where I can find the figure you reproduced. Code that makes a figure that is suppressed in the output file. The reproduced figure (or simplified figure). The actual figure You are to hand-in the .Rmd file and an output file (.html, .pdf, or .docx) Here, is an example of what a completed PART 1 looks like (as an .html output). The graph is Figure 3.1 from Population Ecology: First Principles - Second Edition (Vandermeer and Goldberg) on p67. FIGURE 3.1 Difference in per capita egg production between the O lines and B lines from Rose and Charlesworth’s (1981) experiment. Instructions to complete PART I are here. PART II of this assignment is to clean up messy data. As a biologist, much of my coding work involves getting data into the right format to use in functions, this might be a plot function like ggplot(), which you used in PART I, or a statistical function like lm(), which will perform a regression, t-test, or analysis of variance. The objective of PART II is to practice cleaning messy data into a useable format. You are to clean the messy data from here enough so you can make a plot using ggplot(). Some helpful instructions for how to do this are here. The code that you write must use the select(), mutate(), and ggplot() functions. The graph that you make must be different than the example given in the instructions. (perhaps this sounds easy - this data is pretty messy - I found it quite hard!) ** TO HAND IN** Hand in an .Rmd file and an output file (.html, .docx, or .pdf) with the solutions to both PART I and PART II of this assignment. Each part is 10 marks for a total of 20 marks.

Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the geometric growth model formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the geoemtric growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940.

[two pages prior to the title page] Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched.

"],["partI.html", "PART I - Instructions", " PART I - Instructions For general instructions on installing R, RStudio and installing packages see the Quantitative Training Manual. Install the Rmarkdown package and all dependencies. Install tinytex. In the past we have had some problems with this on PCs. If your tinytex installation fails, what you might try is a package manager for Windows, i.e. Chocolatey or Scoop. See here for details. You are unsuccessful at installing tinytex that is okay, this package is only necessary to produce a .pdf output. You can complete your assignment as a .docx output or .html output. Why use R markdown? Integrate code and write-up to avoid mistakes moving between .R (or other software) for analysis and .docx for write-up. It is easier to find all your work when everything is in one file (or linked to from one file). Run code in the background of your write-up so that if something changes the write-up automatically updates in all the relevant places. The reduces the chances of errors in your write-up. Publish your work as a website. This facilitates hyper-linking, you can update your work at any time, avoiding emailing your work keeps email storage free, and your work can be easily shared (i.e., in conversation I might say ‘that analysis is linked off my faculty website’). Include math symbols quickly because your hands don’t leave the keyboard to make selections from drop-down menus. If your analysis is time-consuming you might not want the calculations in your write-up, slowing the compilation of your write-up. In this case you might have a separate .R analysis file that outputs your results as a .csv or plot. You can read these in automatically to your write-up by specifying the path to the .csv or plot. In R Studio, select File &gt; New Project... &gt; R Markdown. Give the file a name, etc. The default .Rmd opens already with some code to help you. With the default .Rmd opened, there should be a Knit button at the top and center of the Editor pane. Click the Knit button to knit to .pdf, .html, or .docx output. Alternatively, do Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K. (If this did not work, perhaps you have not installed the rmarkdown or tinytex packages) Beside the Knit button is an arrow. You have the option to knit to .pdf, .html, or .docx output. Try producing other outputs. (For me, producing a .docx opened Skype (clearly a bug). This was fixed by using Finder (on my Mac) to find the .docx file that I made, and selecting Open With &gt; Microsoft Word) Below are some things to try, that will help you to complete PART I. Type the code, then Knit to see what happens. Include variables in-text by enclosing in $x$, i.e. this renders as \\(x\\), which is italicized to indicate in your writing that \\(x\\) is a variable rather than a letter. Load data using R commands. (If you want to do this quickly copy and paste the command at the end of this section) Hide the code that loads the data in the output. i.e., read about the options for r code chunks: echo, include, message, warning, eval, and results. Print the data in your output. Show both the code and the output. Try it all! Show only your code print out. Can you do this? ## Psoil Pcorn ## 1 1 64 ## 2 4 71 ## 3 5 54 ## 4 9 81 ## 5 13 93 ## 6 11 76 Include code in-text as `r x `. This renders as 80 because in a hidden coding block I loaded data and assigned x&lt;-mean(data$Pcorn). Therefore, the reported value of \\(x\\) = 80 is the mean phosphorous in the soil for the data I loaded in the background. If the data change, the mean reported in this document will automatically change too. Make headings, subheadings, bold font, etc. Make a hyperlink. Use latex commands to include in-text equations, i.e., $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ renders as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); $\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^x$ renders as \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^x\\). (You may need to type require(tinytex) in the Console to get this to work. `The website Detexify is fun for identifying latex commands for different symbols (Some advanced symbols may require packages that you haven’t installed and therfore won’t work)). Try some more complicated Latex. data &lt;- read.csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/biol-4605-data/main/data/corn.csv&#39;, fill=TRUE) If you would like a more structured introduction to R Markdown you can read R Markdown: the definitive guide. This R markdown cheat sheet is helpful. Some more advanced skills you might learn are making alert boxes, or changing some of the options in the YAML. The alert boxes in this document are made as div class=\"alert alert-info\" between &lt; &gt;, then the text, and closed with /div between &lt; &gt;. My experience making tables in .Rmd has not been good. Usually, I make the table in .docx, print to .pdf, take a screenshot and import the .png to .Rmd or .tex. For your PART I specifically, you need to make a figure in ggplot. For ggplot you need your data as a data frame. The code that I used in the example was: age = seq(1,25) difference = c(-20, -26, -24, -20, -22, -20, -10, 0, 20, 23, 9, 5, 12, 14, 16, 10, 8, 6, 7, 11, 5, 6, 4, 5, 10) data = data.frame(age=age, difference = difference) As you can see, I have guessed the values in the plot and entered them manually. This is okay for the purposes of completing your assignment. (Extra for experts - try a package like scrapR or digitize). You need to install ggplot2. You also need to load that package because we are going to use functions from it now (do this as require(ggplot2)). The code that I used to make my ggplot was: g1=ggplot(data = data, aes(x = age, y = difference)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Adult Age, Days&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Difference&quot;) g1 If you need to add a title, you can add a layer + ggtitle(\"Your title), to control the axis limits, use + xlim(c(-10,10)) (with the values you need). Generally, you should be able to use an internet search to find what you need. You can also read more about ggplot here. To make your figure caption, just type below where your figure prints. To get bold text, use ** bold text ** (but without space between the ** and the text). The last thing we need is to take a screenshot of the figure you are trying to reproduce, and to include it as a figure. I like to put all my figures in a folder named figure. You can read about including a figure that is a .png or other format. Of the options, I find using knitr::include_graphics() within a code chunk best because it seems easier to control the figure size. The code that I used in my example of how I completed PART I was: Now you have all the information you need to complete PART I, you just need to put the pieces together. If you are stuck, ask me or a classmate. "],["partII.html", "PART II - Instructions", " PART II - Instructions Install the dplyr package, all dependencies, and load the package. For instructions to clean data using tidyverse see here First you need to load the messy data from here. It may be helpful to view the data in Excel to understand what it looks like before you import it to R.
