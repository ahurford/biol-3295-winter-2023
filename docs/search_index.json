Office hours: Tuesday 1-2pm; Thursday 1-2pm 1.2 Course Information TR 12.00-12.50pm F 1-1.50pm Classroom: SN3060 (unless stated otherwise on the schedule) All Course Announcements will be made on BrightSpace. Should lectures be remote a WebEx link will be provided on BrightSpace. Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course consists of lectures, 4 data analysis assignments, 2 exams and a final exam.  Course expectations: Please attend lectures and respect the learning environment of other students. If you have COVID-19 please follow university and provincial public health guidelines. Learning goals: The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have seen much of the course material in pre-requisite courses. In this course, I will revisit the models, clarify the assumptions and when they are appropriate, and we will fit the models to data to estimate parameters. By the end of the course, I hope that if you were given population data, that you would know the key quantities that you might estimate, and could complete the analysis. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/biol-3295-winter-2023/index.html. Most readings are assigned from two textbooks that are available electronically from the library: Vandermeer, J.H., Goldberg, D.E., 2013. Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. Link Otto, Sarah P., and Troy Day. 2007. A Biologist’s Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution, Princeton University Press. Link If you wish to use your own computer for assignments you should install R and RStudio (see also here). 1.3 Method of Evaluation 4 Assignments - 20% 2 Exams - 40% Final Exam - 40% Late assignments and missed exams, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). Please discuss missed assignments and exams with me. To accommodate the absence an assignment may be modified or exempted and re-weighted in the grading scheme. 1.4 Additional Policies 1.4.1 Accommodation of students with disabilities Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see www.mun.ca/blundon for more information). 1.4.2 Academic misconduct Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. 1.4.3 Equity and Diversity A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion. You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs. The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class. 1.5 Additional Supports Resources for additional support can be found at: www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/ https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/ "],["schedule.html", "2 Schedule", " 2 Schedule All lectures are in SN 3060 unless otherwise stated Thurs Jan 5: Introduction Fri Jan 6: Population biology with discrete and continuous variables Tues Jan 10: CSF 2218 Introduction to Rmarkdown and tidyverse Assignment 1 is assigned Thurs Jan 12: Geometric growth Fri Jan 13: Geometric growth Tues Jan 17: CSF 2218 Numerical solutions and graphing population data Assignment 1 is due &amp; Assignment 2 is assigned Thurs Jan 19: Exponential growth Fri Jan 20: Exponential growth Tues Jan 24: Density dependence and logistic growth Assignment 2 is due Thurs Jan 26: Density dependence and logistic growth Fri Jan 27: Density dependence and logistic growth Tues Jan 31: Discrete time density dependence Thurs Feb 2: EXAM I (all material covered to date) Fri Feb 3: Age-structured models Tues Feb 7: Stage-structured models Thurs Feb 9: Stage-structured models Fri Feb 10: Stage-structured models Tues Feb 14: CSF 2218 Numerical analysis of stage-structured models Assignment 3 is assigned Thurs Feb 16: Density dependence in stage-structured models Fri Feb 17: Metapopulation models WINTER BREAK Tues Feb 28: Continuous space models Assignment 3 is due Thurs Mar 2: Spatially explicit models in population biology Fri Mar 3: Population dynamics in a warming world Tues Mar 7: Spatially explicit population dynamics in a warming world Thurs Mar 9: Disease dynamics Fri Mar 10: The net reproduction number Tues Mar 14: Overview of models in population biology Thurs Mar 16: EXAM II (All material since Exam I) Fri Mar 17: What is evolutionary ecology?

Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the geometric growth model formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the geoemtric growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940.

[two pages prior to the title page] Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female.
