All Course Announcements will be made on BrightSpace. Should lectures be remote a WebEx link will be provided on BrightSpace.

Course description:\\
Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210.\\

Course format:\\
The course consists of lectures, 4 data analysis assignments, 2 exams and a final exam.~

Course expectations:\\
Please attend lectures and respect the learning environment of other students. If you have COVID-19 please follow university and provincial public health guidelines.\\

Learning goals:\\
The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have seen much of the course material in pre-requisite courses. In this course, I will revisit the models, clarify the assumptions and when they are appropriate, and we will fit the models to data to estimate parameters. By the end of the course, I hope that if you were given population data, that you would know the key quantities that you might estimate, and could complete the analysis.

Required Text and Resources:\\
The course materials are online at \url{https://ahurford.github.io/biol-3295-winter-2023/index.html}.

Most readings are assigned from two textbooks that are available electronically from the library:

\subsection{Accommodation of students with disabilities}\label{accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities}}

Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see \url{www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239}. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see \url{www.mun.ca/blundon} for more information).

\hypertarget{academic-misconduct}{%
\subsection{Academic misconduct}\label{academic-misconduct}}

Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12.

\hypertarget{equity-and-diversity}{%
\subsection{Equity and Diversity}\label{equity-and-diversity}}

A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion.

You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs.

The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class.

Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \(N_{t+1}\) and \(N_t\) in the geometric growth model formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \(\lambda\) in the geoemtric growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported.

Newcomb, HR. 1940. \href{https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/js956j801?locale=en}{Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca}, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. {[}two pages prior to the title page{]}

\item
  Pheasant chicks are born during the summer.
\item
  In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35.
\item
  November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants.
\item
  October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants.
\item
  Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died.
\item
  During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57\% of eggs hatched.
\item
  During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58\% hatched.
\item
  During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\(^1\)
\item
  You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species.
\end{enumerate}

\(^1\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory.
